# OXS Specification

[OXS](https://ursasoftware.com/OXSFormat) is an open cross-stitch file format developed by _[UrsaSoftware](https://ursasoftware.com)_.
It is just an XML, so it is easy to explore its structure.
Also, it is a very extendable format, so everyone can add their properties to the patterns.
We just copy-pasted the format description, rephrased it to make it more straightforward, and added more examples.
