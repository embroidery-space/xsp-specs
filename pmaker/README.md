## XSD

XSD is a proprietary cross-stitch file format used by the _[Pattern Maker for Cross Stitch](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127080612/http://hobbyware.com)_.
It is a binary format with quite a weird structure and compressed stitches data.

See [`xsd.hexpat`](./patterns/xsd.hexpat) to examine the XSD patterns structure.

## Palette

Pattern Maker stores color palettes in `.Master` and `.User` files (original and custom, respectively).

See [`palette.hexpat`](./patterns/palette.hexpat) to examine the structure of color palettes.

## Color Brand and Fabric Color Lists

Pattern Maker stores a list of supported color palettes in the `Color_Brand_List` file and fabric colors in the `Fabric_Colors` file.

See [`Color_Brand_List.hexpat`](./patterns/Color_Brand_List.hexpat) and [`Fabric_Colors.hexpat`](./patterns/Fabric_Colors.hexpat) to examine their structures.
