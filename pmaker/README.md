# XSD Specification

XSD is a proprietary cross-stitch file format used by the _[Pattern Maker for Cross Stitch](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127080612/http://hobbyware.com)_.
It is a binary format with quite a weird structure and compressed stitches data.
Its structure is described in hex patterns using [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex)'s syntax.
We are learning more about this format through reverse engineering.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the `.hexpat`, open a file you want to view in ImHex, import a hex pattern and save the project as `.hexproj` in the `pmaker/` folder under this repository.
> Then you could run hex pattern without any errors.
