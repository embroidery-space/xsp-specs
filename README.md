# Cross-Stitch Pattern Specifications

This repository contains specifications for the cross-stitch pattern file formats supported by the [Embroidery Studio](https://github.com/embroidery-space/embroidery-studio).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the resources are specified using [ImHex's pattern syntax](https://docs.werwolv.net/pattern-language).
> To use the `.hexpat` patterns, configure the [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex).
>
> First, open ImHex settings (_Extras_ -> _Settings_, or use `Ctrl+,` shortcuts) and go to the _Folders_ tab.
> Then, click the _Add new folder_ button and select the `imhex/` folder.
> This will allow ImHex to import our custom utilities and use them in hex patterns.
>
> Now, you can open a file you want to view in ImHex.
> To import a hex pattern, open pattern browser (_File_ -> _Import_ -> _Pattern File_) and select the desired hex pattern file.
